                        informs us about the systems state, its operation and its efficiency.
                        It doesn't matter how we record them, its really hard to navigate within the precise results,
                        and see the correlations, if we can see only the numbers.
                        The more data we have, it's all the more necessery to see through them easily
                        Using various visualizaton-techniques, some pieces of information come to light, which,
                        regarding only the numerical data would remain unnoticed.
                        It is adviseable to portray these data in dynamic and interactive ways, which helps us noticing
                        the key informations.
                        For example, the presentation can happen using dots, stripes, lines or hystogramms.
                        A well structured and used datavisualization helps making important strategic and planning
                        decisions, as the information from may source is more easy to see through, analyzing these clear
                        data can move important judgments forward.

            <h3>Henry L. Gantt</h3>
            <p>He began his carreer at an iron foundry, then he worked on controlling principles alongside Frederick
                Taylor.
                As counselor, he was well respected in the field of general leadership, and during the first world war,
                he was employed by the U.S. government.
                He died not long after the end of the conflict in 1919.

            <h3>Gantt-chart</h3>
            <p>Regarding any timing task or projekt, all coagulate from multi-layer activities.
                It is necessary to create thoose processes, which show us all the steps from discovering reality to
                constructing our model
    
                Gantt-diagrams are indispensable parts of both process organisation and projekt planning and tracking.
            </p>
            <p>The advantage of a Gantt chart lies in how easy it is to understand. The various activities or
                work packages are listed one above the other on the left, while the corresponding lanes on the right are listed
                the duration of each activity is plotted on a horizontal timeline. For example, if project phase A
                the half-path of the B column overlaps the band of the Phase B
                may begin as soon as phase A is completed. The dependencies between the phases of the project are also indicated by arrows
                can be represented.</p>

            <h3>Gantt heritage</h3>
            <p>
                Although Gantt is known today primarily for this central idea, many of his other achievements are no
                less
                progressive. For example, he designed the “task and reward system”. In this system, employees a
                they receive a percentage bonus over their normal salary if they reach a certain daily wage. The most
                the faster they do their job, the higher their additional bonus pay. For slower wages
                penalties imposed are expressly excluded. Gantt was about motivating people instead of
                would put pressure on them. He later promoted the idea of ​​rewarding managers when their employees
                achieved the set goals. An incentive had to be created for employees to share their expertise.
